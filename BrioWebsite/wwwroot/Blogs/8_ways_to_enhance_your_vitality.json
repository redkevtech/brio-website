    "<ol><li><strong>Get outside.</strong> The high-vitality elders that Dan Buettner studies in Okinawa, Costa Rica, and other pockets of longevity enjoy an active life surrounded by nature. To learn how time spent outside can help sustain and energize you, read this article.</li><li><strong>Cultivate community.</strong> A lack of close relationships has been shown to weaken our immune systems and sap our vitality. Maintaining strong social ties with others improves many aspects of both health and wellness. So does volunteering. For more on the benefits of being part of a strong community, see \"Community Matters.\"</li><li><strong>Be a lifelong learner.</strong> More education leads to longer, healthier lives. A 2003 study published in the journal Neurology found an inverse relationship between how many years of formal education Alzheimer’s patients have and how quickly they succumb to the disease.</li><li><strong>Calm down.</strong> Chronic stress releases hormones that can damage cells, tissues, and organ systems, all of which can shorten your life expectancy. Learn more in \"Putting Stress in Its Place.\"</li><li><strong>Honor your promises.</strong> Each time you break a promise, whether it’s to a loved one or to yourself, you lose a sense of connection with your own values. Keep your promises and you gain integrity and self-respect, two main ingredients for vitality.</li><li><strong>Plug your \"energy leaks.\"</strong> Notice where you are losing energy. Reevaluate lifeless jobs, negative relationships, poor eating habits, sedentary patterns, and other parts of your life that drain your energy. Eliminate these energy drainers as much as possible, and replace them with health and wellness practices.</li><li><strong>Don’t skimp on sleep.</strong> Chronic sleep deprivation increases your odds of suffering from both heart disease and diabetes. It also reduces your immunity and your ability to cope productively with everyday challenges. Get to bed by 10 PM so you can be sure to get plenty of sleep and wake up feeling alive and well in the morning!</li><li><strong>Take good care of your brain & spinal cord.</strong> Your brain and spinal cord (central nervous system - CNS) control your ability to do everything. When your CNS is functioning at its optimal capacity, you feel alive, full of energy, and vitality. However, daily wear and tear, the stress of jobs and relationships, have a direct impact on the health of your CNS, causing muscle tension, joint pain, and different types of headaches that lead to subluxations (misalignments) in the spine and other joints of the body. Regular chiropractic adjustments restore the function of these joints and free the CNS to return to its optimal function. When was the last time you were checked by a chiropractor to make sure your brain and spinal cord are free from interference?</li></ol>",
